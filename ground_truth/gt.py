Electronically: You can sign up for Manulife's Plan Member Secure Site at www.manulife.ca/groupbenefits to submit claims online.
By Mail: You'll need to complete an applicable claim form and mail it to Manulife, following the instructions on the form.
Dental Claims: Your dentist can submit these electronically on your behalf, or you can complete a standard dental claim form yourself.
Disability Claims: For disability claims, you'll need to complete a Short Term Disability/Long Term Disability Member's statement. For Long Term Disability or Waiver of Premiums, an attending physician must also complete a corresponding statement.
You can find all necessary claim forms at www.manulife.ca/groupbenefits or by contacting your plan administrator.
Does this information help, or would you like more specific details on one of these submission methods?""",
